# AES-128_VHDL
AES-128 realization on VHDL for FPGA

The goal of this project is design of FPGA implementation AES-128 with simple structure. This design is not necessary for maximum perfomance but is simple enough to understanding this algorithm and think about yourself implementation for your requirements.
